# Product Marketing Context

*Last updated: 2026-02-19*

## Product Overview
**One-liner:** A GoHighLevel-based system for attracting, organizing, and scaling relationships with affiliates, advertisers, and strategic partners.
**What it does:** Formalizes Jackie's relationship-building skills into a structured CRM system. Captures contacts from Facebook groups, Messenger, Telegram, and email — then organizes, vets, and nurtures them through automated pipelines toward active partnerships.
**Product category:** Affiliate Network / CRM
**Product type:** Service (GHL-powered system)
**Business model:** Contact organization and relationship-building first. Revenue via affiliate commissions, then evolving into agency retainers. Monetization is secondary to building the network asset.

## Target Audience
**Primary — Affiliates:**
- Performance marketers looking for reliable offers to promote
- Found in Facebook groups, Telegram channels, and industry forums
- Jackie recruits them via personal networking and organic outreach
- Immediate advantage: funneling new affiliates into 713's existing operations

**Secondary — Advertisers:**
- Companies/brands seeking quality affiliate traffic
- Looking for vetted partners rather than high-volume, low-trust networks
- Come later once the affiliate base is established

**Jobs to be done:**
- Organize scattered contacts (FB Messenger, Telegram, email) into one place
- Vet and qualify potential partners before engaging
- Automate follow-ups so no relationship falls through the cracks
- Track partnership progress from first contact to active collaboration

## Personas
| Persona | Cares about | Challenge | Value we promise |
|---------|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Affiliate** | High-converting offers, trustworthy network operators | Finding reliable partners in a crowded, spam-heavy space | A personal, trust-based network run by a real person (Jackie) |
| **Advertiser** | Quality traffic, ROI, vetted affiliates | Scaling campaigns without sacrificing traffic quality | Access to a curated, relationship-vetted affiliate network |
| **Jackie (operator)** | Building authority, staying organized | Managing dozens of conversations across multiple platforms | A structured system that turns networking into a repeatable business |

## Problems & Pain Points
**Core problem:** The performance marketing space is fragmented — contacts are scattered across Messenger, Telegram, email, and group chats with no system to organize, vet, or follow up.
**Why alternatives fall short:** Generic CRMs don't have affiliate-specific pipeline stages. Manual spreadsheets can't automate follow-ups. Existing affiliate networks are transactional, not relationship-driven.
**What it costs them:** Missed connections, forgotten follow-ups, wasted time on unqualified contacts, inability to scale beyond personal memory.
**Emotional tension:** Feeling overwhelmed by volume of conversations; fear of missing opportunities; desire for professional authority in the space.

## Competitive Landscape
**Direct:** Large affiliate networks (ClickBank, ShareASale, CJ) — fall short because they're impersonal and transactional. Jackie's edge is personal trust.
**Secondary:** Manual outreach via spreadsheets/notes — falls short because it doesn't scale and has no automation.
**Indirect:** Other affiliate managers/brokers — Jackie differentiates through her organic Facebook presence and mentored approach.

## Differentiation
**Key differentiators:**
- Jackie as the personal, trust-driven face of the network
- Female presence in a male-dominated space (noted as an advantage)
- Organic Facebook growth strategy (not paid acquisition)
- Structured GHL automation behind Jackie's personal touch
- Mentored by an experienced operator behind the scenes
**Why that's better:** Higher trust = higher quality partnerships. Personal relationships retain better than automated networks.

## Switching Dynamics
**Push:** Frustrated with disorganized contacts; tired of missing follow-ups; ready to "get serious" about affiliate networking
**Pull:** A clean, automated system that makes Jackie look professional and organized from day one
**Habit:** Currently using FB Messenger/Telegram directly — familiar but unscalable
**Anxiety:** Will the system actually get used? Will it be too complicated?

## Customer Language
**How they describe the problem:**
- "I need to organize my contacts"
- "I have conversations everywhere — Messenger, Telegram, email"
- "I should have built this 10 years ago"
**Words to use:** Network, partner, relationship, trust, vetted, organized, scale
**Words to avoid:** Spam, blast, mass outreach, cold email, automated (when describing Jackie's personal touch)

## Brand Voice
**Tone:** Professional but approachable; trust-driven; premium
**Style:** Direct, relationship-first, confident without being salesy
**Personality:** Relatable, organized, credible, strategic

## Proof Points
**Value themes:**
| Theme | Proof |
|-------|-------|
| Relationship-led growth | Jackie's natural networking ability, already connecting people |
| Operational structure | GHL automation formalizes what she does organically |
| Strategic mentorship | Experienced operator guiding strategy behind the scenes |
| Immediate network value | 713 as existing client/partner for affiliate recruitment |

## Goals
**Business goal:** Build a structured affiliate network asset under the JacklynSellz brand, with a path toward a boutique marketing agency.
**Conversion action:** Capture inbound affiliate/advertiser interest via landing page and segment into the correct GHL pipeline.
**Immediate priority:** Organize existing contacts and begin vetting/nurturing workflows — landing page comes last after the backend is built.

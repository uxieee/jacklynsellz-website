## Affiliate Pipeline Emails

### Email 1: Affiliate Welcome
**Automation #1 — Trigger: Enters "New Contact" stage**

**Subject:** Welcome to the JacklynSellz Network
**From:** Jackie <jackie@jacklynsellz.com>

---

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

Thanks for connecting — I'm glad you're here.

I'm Jackie, and I run a performance marketing network focused on building real partnerships, not just filling a roster. Every affiliate I work with is someone I've personally vetted and believe in.

Here's how this works:

1. **I review your info** to understand your experience and niche
2. **We connect** to make sure we're a good fit for each other
3. **I match you with offers** that align with your strengths

I'll be reviewing your profile in the next 48 hours. In the meantime, if there's anything you want me to know — your best verticals, traffic sources, or what you're looking for — just reply to this email.

Talk soon,
Jackie

**Psychology:** Reciprocity (providing clear process upfront), Authority (structured vetting), Personal touch (first-person, conversational).

**Subject:** You've been qualified — here's what's next
**From:** Jackie

---

Hey {{contact.first_name}},

Good news — I've reviewed your profile and you're a great fit for the network.

Here's what happens next:

**I'll match you with offers** based on your niche ({{contact.affiliate_niche}}) and traffic sources. I only work with advertisers I've personally vetted, so you'll never waste time on low-quality offers.

Before I can officially bring you on board, I just need a quick confirmation:

→ **Reply with "I'm in"** and I'll move forward with your onboarding.

If you have any questions about how the network operates, just ask. I'm an open book.

**What I need from you:**

I'll be reaching out in the next few days with some offers that match your profile.

Let's build something good,

{{contact.first_name}},

I've got a few offers that could be a strong fit for you. I'm going to send those over separately, but first I want to set expectations:

- Consistent communication
- Honest reporting
- Long-term thinking over quick wins

If that sounds like how you operate, we're going to work well together.

Keep an eye out for my next message with specific offer details.

## Advertiser Pipeline Emails

### Email 7: Advertiser Welcome
**Automation #6 — Trigger: Enters "New Prospect" stage**

**Subject:** Welcome — let's explore how we can work together
**From:** Jackie

---

Hi {{contact.first_name}},

Thanks for your interest in the JacklynSellz network.

I run a curated affiliate network focused on quality over quantity. Every affiliate in my network is personally vetted — no bots, no fraud, no wasted budget.

Here's my process:

1. **I learn about your offer** — vertical, payout, GEOs, landing pages
2. **I identify the right affiliates** from my network for your offer
3. **We test, optimize, and scale** together

I'd love to learn more about what you're promoting. Can you reply with:
- Your offer type (CPA, CPL, CPS, etc.)
- Your target GEOs
- Your current payout range

That's all I need to get started.

Jackie

---

**Psychology:** Authority (structured process), Reciprocity (she asks for small info, promises to match), Pratfall Effect (honest about being curated/small = trustworthy).

### Email 8: Advertiser Intro
**Automation #7 — Trigger: Enters "Intro" stage**

**Subject:** Here's what the JacklynSellz network can do for you
**From:** Jackie

---

{{contact.first_name}},

Thanks for sharing your offer details. Here's a quick overview of how I operate:

**The JacklynSellz Network:**
- Personally vetted affiliates across multiple verticals
- Focus on sustainable, scalable partnerships
- Direct line to me for support and optimization

**What makes us different:**
Most networks throw your offer at hundreds of affiliates and hope something sticks. I take a different approach — I match your offer with 3-5 affiliates who have proven results in your vertical. Smaller volume, higher quality.

If that approach resonates, let's discuss the specifics of your offer and I'll let you know how we can help.

### Email 9: Advertiser Negotiation Follow-Up
**Automation #8 — Trigger: Enters "Negotiation" stage**

**Subject:** Let's finalize the details
**From:** Jackie

---

{{contact.first_name}},

I'm excited about this — your offer looks like a strong fit for several affiliates in my network.

To move forward, I'll need:
- [ ] Final payout/commission terms
- [ ] Approved landing page(s)
- [ ] Any compliance or creative guidelines
- [ ] Tracking link setup details

Once I have these, I can start matching you with the right affiliates and get a test running within the week.

Let me know if you have any questions about the process.

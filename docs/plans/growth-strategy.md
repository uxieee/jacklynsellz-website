## Current Stage: Pre-Launch / Early Stage

Jackie is building her Facebook presence organically, networking in groups, and just getting the GHL system set up. Budget is low, team is solo (with mentorship). Growth tactics must be **free or low-cost**, **relationship-driven**, and **immediately actionable**.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

### Goal: Get first 20-30 affiliates into the pipeline

| Tactic | How | Timeline | Cost |
|--------|-----|----------|------|
| **Facebook Group Networking** | Join 5-10 affiliate/performance marketing groups. Comment meaningfully (not spammy). DM people who engage. | Daily, 30 min | Free |
| **Telegram Channel Outreach** | Identify 3-5 active affiliate Telegram groups. Build presence, then DM prospects. | Daily, 20 min | Free |
| **Personal Profile Building** | Post 3-5x/week on Jackie's FB profile: tips, industry insights, partnership wins (even small ones). | Consistent | Free |
| **Direct Messaging Harvesting** | Turn FB Messenger and Telegram conversations into GHL contacts using the intake form or manual entry. | As conversations happen | Free |
| **Referral Seeding** | Ask first approved affiliates: "Know anyone else who'd be a good fit?" Tag as `source-referral`. | After each approval | Free |

### Success Metrics
- 20-30 contacts in Affiliate Pipeline
- 5-10 moved past "Vetting" stage
- Jackie posting consistently on FB profile

## Phase 2: Traction (Weeks 5-12)

### Goal: First live advertiser deals, 50+ affiliates, establish credibility

| Tactic | How | Timeline | Cost |
|--------|-----|----------|------|
| **Comment Marketing** | Reply to popular posts in affiliate groups with genuine insight (not links). People will check Jackie's profile → bio → landing page. | Daily, 15 min | Free |
| **Founder-Led Content** | Jackie shares "day in the life" stories, lessons learned, and behind-the-scenes of building the network. Builds authority. | 2-3x/week | Free |
| **Integration with 713** | Funnel 713's existing needs into Jackie's network. This gives her real deals to offer affiliates immediately. | Ongoing | Free |
| **Newsletter Swap** | Find 2-3 small affiliate newsletters. Offer to cross-promote: Jackie mentions their newsletter, they mention JacklynSellz. | Once set up | Free |
| **Facebook Messenger → GHL Integration** | Set up FB Messenger integration in GHL so conversations auto-create contacts. Reduces manual entry. | One-time setup | GHL feature |
| **Warm Introductions** | Ask mentor to introduce Jackie to existing advertiser contacts. Leverage existing relationships. | As appropriate | Free |

### Success Metrics
- 50+ affiliates in pipeline
- 3-5 active advertiser deals
- At least 1 partnership generating revenue
- Jackie recognized in 2-3 FB groups as a contributor

---

## Phase 3: Scale (Months 3-6)

### Goal: Establish JacklynSellz as a known name, 100+ affiliates, agency foundation

| Tactic | How | Timeline | Cost |
|--------|-----|----------|------|
| **Landing Page Launch** | Step 8 of our plan — professional inbound capture. Share link in bio, groups, and DMs. | One-time build | Build cost |
| **Case Studies** | Document first successful affiliate-advertiser matches. "How [Affiliate] generated [X] with [Advertiser] through JacklynSellz." | After first wins | Free |
| **Podcast/Webinar Guesting** | Jackie appears on 1-2 small affiliate marketing podcasts or webinars as a guest. Shares her journey. | Monthly | Free |
| **Tiered Referral Program** | Activate tiered incentives (Bronze/Silver/Gold) from the referral design. Top affiliates get priority offers. | When 30+ active affiliates | Low |
| **LinkedIn Presence** | Expand from FB-only to LinkedIn. Position Jackie as an affiliate marketing professional. | Weekly posts | Free |
| **Exclusive Offers Strategy** | Negotiate 1-2 exclusive or semi-exclusive deals with advertisers. Use as a draw for top affiliates. | Ongoing | Free |

### Success Metrics
- 100+ affiliates in pipeline, 30+ active
- 10+ advertiser deals live
- Revenue from commissions or network fees
- Inbound interest coming through landing page (not just outbound)

## Phase 4: Agency Evolution (Months 6-12)

### Goal: Transition from network to boutique agency model

| Tactic | How | Timeline | Cost |
|--------|-----|----------|------|
| **Retainer Model** | Offer advertisers a managed service: Jackie handles affiliate recruitment, campaign optimization, and reporting for a monthly fee. | When 5+ live advertisers | Pricing TBD |
| **Digital Products** | Create a guide or mini-course: "How to Get Started in Affiliate Marketing" — use as a lead magnet or paid product. | One-time | Low |
| **Performance Dashboard** | Build a simple reporting view for advertisers — shows which affiliates are driving results. | One-time | Build cost |
| **Team Expansion** | Bring on 1 VA to handle data entry and follow-ups, freeing Jackie for high-value relationship work. | When revenue supports it | ~$500/mo |
| **Conference Networking** | Attend 1-2 affiliate marketing conferences (Affiliate Summit, etc.). Meet people in person. | Semi-annual | $500-$2K |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Don't Do This | Why | Do This Instead |
|---------------|-----|-----------------|
| Blast-messaging FB groups | Gets Jackie banned, destroys reputation | Comment thoughtfully, DM individually |
| Over-automating early | Jackie's edge IS her personal touch | Automate admin tasks, keep outreach personal |
| Chasing volume over quality | Low-quality affiliates waste advertiser trust | Vet carefully, grow slowly |
| Building landing page first | No audience to send there yet | Build the network first, page later |
| Waiting for "perfect" system | GHL is a tool, not the business | Start conversations NOW, optimize system later |
